# For Educators

**WELCOME** to your new arena of challenge and growth! As you embark on this thrilling journey to create a battle, we invite you to dive into the `tests.test` file to carve out the challenges your students will face. Here, you're not just educators; you're architects of learning experiences. We encourage you to weave in engaging descriptions, captivating stories, and practical examples right below this section. At CKB, we believe learning should be as enjoyable as it is enriching—so let's make it a memorable adventure for our students!

Don't forget an essential step: naming your battle in the **boilerplate/group_info.json** file. This is where your creativity shines, setting the tone for the challenges ahead.

Your students will step into the role of heroes, tackling the tasks you've devised in the `implementation.py` file. Encourage them to unleash their ingenuity and problem-solving skills on your ingeniously crafted puzzles. Yes, we urge you to challenge them fiercely (all in the spirit of education, of course) but also to foster a supportive environment that nudges them towards growth.

Once your battleground is set, and your tests are ready to challenge the minds of our future problem-solvers, head over to https://codekatabattles.streamlit.app to bring your battle to life. Share the link to this repository on the battle page, and watch as the community rallies to conquer the challenges you've laid out. Thank you for contributing to the intellectual development of our brightest minds. Together, we're not just teaching code; we're shaping futures.

## Battle Info Template

=== EDUCATOR: INSERT BATTLE DESCRIPTION HERE ===

Craft a story, set the scene, and define the challenge. This is where you captivate and motivate your students to dive headfirst into the problem-solving process.

## Participating

**First**, make your mark by noting your group name and repository details in the `boilerplate/group_info.json`. This is how you claim your space in this exciting world of coding battles.

**Second**, it's time to GET CoOoOdIiIiNG! Dive into the implementation with all the creativity and technical prowess you possess. Remember, while you're free to architect an elaborate solution, it should ultimately spring to life through `boilerplate.implementation.main`. This is where your code meets the challenge head-on.

**Have fun!!!!** This isn't just a suggestion; it's a command. We believe that enjoyment is a crucial component of learning. When you're having fun, you're more open, engaged, and ready to tackle even the toughest challenges. Let's make this experience one that you and your students will remember fondly.

Together, let's turn coding into an adventure that educates, inspires, and entertains. Welcome to the community, and happy coding!
